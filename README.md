- 👋 Hi, I’m @YdalirU, I am an Electronics Engineer and Technical Writer/Editor, working for Railway Industry.
      My native language is German, I am quite good at English.
      I started to program using Assembler, BASIC, C, Pascal/Turbo Pascal/Delphi followed by HTML, Java Script, CSS, C# 
			and Python but every language only as far as I had to dig in to. Probably I have more forgotten than I ever have touched.
      I got my fingers wet with LISP and FORTH.
      Besides that I workd with databases (MS SQL, My SQL, DOORS). I write manuals and technical descriptions for a living.
			My preferred operating system is (obviously) Linux.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming ESP32/ARDUINO/RaspberryPi, DIY Projects, covering any programming language necessary to do that.
      Currently I am working on several projects which include (besides hardware including 3D printing) C, CPP, HTML, CSS, Java Script, Python, Micro Python
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning Java Script and CSS (All the new stuff, due to the fact that my last encounter has been some years ago) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translation of tutorials or other descriptive text, like UIs (Localization)
- 📫 You can send me an EMail to ydalir@hallerbach.eu
